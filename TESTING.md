## Validation
To ensure the reliability, usability, and accessibility of Chalk Talk, various validation methodologies were implemented. These validations ensure that the application not only meets development standards but also provides a seamless user experience across different platforms and browsers. Below is an overview of the validation processes.

### HTML Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [HTML W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
-   **Purpose:** Validates the HTML code of the application to ensure it is free from syntax errors and adheres to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
-   **Process:** All HTML pages of Chalk Talk are checked through the W3C validator to identify and fix any markup errors or warnings.

Validation results with no errors in index.html:

![HTML validator](./readme/testing/html_validator_url.png)

### CSS Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
-   **Purpose:** Ensures the CSS code is compliant with W3C standards, free from syntax errors, and follows best practices for styling.
-   **Process:** All CSS files are validated through the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify and rectify any issues.

![CSS Validation](./readme/testing/css_validator.png)

**CSS Warnings:** This project includes custom styles that make use of vendor-specific extensions and pseudo-elements to ensure a consistent and polished user experience across various browsers and operating systems. During the linting process, certain warnings may appear, indicating the use of these vendor-specific extensions. These warnings are expected and can be safely ignored.

### JavaScript Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
-   **Purpose:** To detect errors and potential problems in the JavaScript code, ensuring that all scripts run efficiently and are error-free. ESLint helps enforce consistent coding styles and best practices by identifying and fixing problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
-   **Process:** JavaScript code is run through ESLint to identify issues related to syntax, deprecated methods, and other inefficiencies.

**Steps to Run JavaScript Validation**
-   Install Dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed by running: `npm install`
-   Run ESLint: To run ESLint across the whole project and identify any issues: `npx eslint .`

![ESLint warnings](./readme/testing/warnings_eslint.png)

    -   After fixing the warnings and installing "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" as suggested all warnings are now cleared.
 
**Prettier for Code Formatting**

To maintain a consistent code style across the project I used the terminal to run Prettier on my entire project:
-   Install Prettier globally: `npm install -g prettier`
-   Run: `prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx}"`

## Lighthouse
-   **Tool Used:** [Google Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lighthouse) is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It performs audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. 
-   **Purpose:** To assess the quality of web pages in terms of performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and best practices.
-   **Process:** Chalk Talk is tested with Google Lighthouse, which provides a detailed report on various aspects of the siteâ€™s performance and offers recommendations for improvement.

**Home Page**

**Sign In Page**

![Lighthouse test Sign In page](./readme/testing/lighthouse_signin.png)

**Sign Up Page**

**Add Post page**

![Lighthouse test Add Post](./readme/testing/lighthouse_add_post.png)

**Post detail page**

![Lighthouse test Post detail](./readme/testing/lighthouse_post_detail.png)

**PR's Page**

![Lighthouse test PR's page](./readme/testing/lighthouse_pr_page.png)

**Profile Page**

![Lighthouse test Profile page](./readme/testing/lighthouse_profile.png)

I have compressed some images, but could not increase the performance scores.
Best practices show a score of 79 on some pages and it is due to refresh tokens.

Comparing the Lighthouse scores for Chalk Talk to other social media platforms, such as Instagram, I find the above scores ok.

![Instagram Lighthouse scores](./readme/testing/lighthouse_instagram.png)


## Wave Accessibility Evaluation
-   **Tool Used:** Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
-   **Purpose:** To ensure that the website is accessible to individuals with disabilities by identifying and suggesting fixes for web accessibility issues.
-   **Process:** The Wave tool evaluates each page of Chalk Talk to ensure it complies with accessibility standards like WCAG and Section 508.

### Responsiveness
Responsiveness and interactive elements were thoroughly tested on various devices and through browser developer tools to ensure a seamless user experience across different platforms and screen sizes.

| Device/Method | Features Tested |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Chrome DevTools | All |
| Firefox Responsive Mode | All |
| iPhone 14 | Navigation, Home, Sign Up |

I have an issue logging in to the app on iPhone and I have been searching for the answer to why that is.
It is not easy to find but there was also a discussion on Slack in this [thread](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C02MTH5MBDG/p1659705919570999) on the topic.
I have tried the suggested solution but still not working.

## User story testing
During development the [Chalk Talk project](https://github.com/users/SophieTiger/projects/5) was utilizing a kanban board with all User stories added to it, that were worked through in Iterations.
Every user story has acceptance criteria and tasks added to them, which were all tested during the development process.

![User story tests](./readme/testing/user_story_tests.png)

## Automated Testing
### Tools Used
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework for creating and running tests.
- React Testing Library: A set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details.

**Key areas tested:**
- Component Rendering: Ensure components render as expected.
- User Interactions: Verify interactions like user signing in.

### Running Tests
1. **Install the dependencies:** `npm install`
2. **Run the tests:** `npm test`
3. **Following red-green-refactoring:**
  - Adding a test that will fail:

  ![navbar fail pr page](./readme/testing/jest_navbar_pr_fail.png)

  - Changing it to pass:

  ![navbar pass pr page](./readme/testing/jest_navbar_pr_pass.png)

4. **All tests for navbar pass:**
