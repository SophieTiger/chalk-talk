## Validation
To ensure the reliability, usability, and accessibility of Chalk Talk, various validation methodologies were implemented. These validations ensure that the application not only meets development standards but also provides a seamless user experience across different platforms and browsers. Below is an overview of the validation processes.

### HTML Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [HTML W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
-   **Purpose:** Validates the HTML code of the application to ensure it is free from syntax errors and adheres to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
-   **Process:** All HTML pages of Chalk Talk are checked through the W3C validator to identify and fix any markup errors or warnings.
