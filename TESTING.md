## Validation
To ensure the reliability, usability, and accessibility of Chalk Talk, various validation methodologies were implemented. These validations ensure that the application not only meets development standards but also provides a seamless user experience across different platforms and browsers. Below is an overview of the validation processes.

### HTML Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [HTML W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
-   **Purpose:** Validates the HTML code of the application to ensure it is free from syntax errors and adheres to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
-   **Process:** All HTML pages of Chalk Talk are checked through the W3C validator to identify and fix any markup errors or warnings.

Validation results with errors in index.html:
![HTML validator errors](./readme/testing/index.html_errors.png)

To test if this is an issue on the deployed site I inspected the page source in the browser to see if the %PUBLIC_URL% placeholders had been replaced with actual paths:
![index.html page source](./readme/testing/page_source_index.png)

Since the %PUBLIC_URL% was not present I assume that this indicates that the build process on Heroku is handling the %PUBLIC_URL% placeholders as expected. The Create React App build tool is replacing these placeholders with the appropriate root path for the deployed application.

When removing %PUBLIC_URL% from the code in the validator, all errors are gone:
![HTML validator no errors](./readme/testing/index.html_validation.png)

### CSS Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
-   **Purpose:** Ensures the CSS code is compliant with W3C standards, free from syntax errors, and follows best practices for styling.
-   **Process:** All CSS files are validated through the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify and rectify any issues.

**CSS Warnings:** This project includes custom styles that make use of vendor-specific extensions and pseudo-elements to ensure a consistent and polished user experience across various browsers and operating systems. During the linting process, certain warnings may appear, indicating the use of these vendor-specific extensions. These warnings are expected and can be safely ignored.

### JavaScript Validation
-   **Tool Used:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
-   **Purpose:** To detect errors and potential problems in the JavaScript code, ensuring that all scripts run efficiently and are error-free. ESLint helps enforce consistent coding styles and best practices by identifying and fixing problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
-   **Process:** JavaScript code is run through ESLint to identify issues related to syntax, deprecated methods, and other inefficiencies.

**Steps to Run JavaScript Validation**
-   Install Dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed by running: `npm install`
-   Run ESLint: To run ESLint across the whole project and identify any issues: `npx eslint .`

![ESLint warnings](./readme/testing/warnings_eslint.png)
    -   After fixing the warnings and installing "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" as suggested all warnings are now cleared.
 
**Prettier for Code Formatting**
To maintain a consistent code style across the project I used the terminal to run Prettier on my entire project:
-   Install Prettier globally: `npm install -g prettier`
-   Run: `prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx}"`

## Lighthouse
-   **Tool Used:** [Google Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lighthouse)
-   **Purpose:** To assess the quality of web pages in terms of performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and best practices.
-   **Process:** Chalk Talk is tested with Google Lighthouse, which provides a detailed report on various aspects of the siteâ€™s performance and offers recommendations for improvement.

## Wave Accessibility Evaluation
-   **Tool Used:** Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
-   **Purpose:** To ensure that the website is accessible to individuals with disabilities by identifying and suggesting fixes for web accessibility issues.
-   **Process:** The Wave tool evaluates each page of Chalk Talk to ensure it complies with accessibility standards like WCAG and Section 508.

Thorough testing was conducted on all pages, functionality and forms throughout Chalk Talk to ensure accurate user input validation and to provide necessary feedback.

I have an issue logging in to the app on iPhone and I have been searching for the answer to why that is.
It is not easy to find but there was also a discussion on Slack in this [thread](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C02MTH5MBDG/p1659705919570999) on the topic.
I have tried the suggested solution but still not working.
